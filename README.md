# Vacuum-PH203_Project

## Throughput and Pumping Speed Calculator

In this project, we have deployed a web application interface for the calculation of throughput and pumping speed using two different methods i.e. using gas equation and the formula for pumping speed for a diaphragm pump. Details about the theory can be found in the report.
